# Project 3: Pizza
---
### Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
#### Note: bolded points are works in progress

Project 3 gets us to use Django, a Python-based free and open-source web framework to create a semi-complex, database-driven website, or a full-service Pizza website that handles:
1. User registration / login / logout
2. Full menu of a variety of different items stored in a database (Django's default -- SQLite)
3. Ability for site admins to add/update/remove items into  menu through Django Admin at URL localhost/admin
4. **Shopping cart where user can view his added items and total price, etc**
5. **Ability to place order once at least one item is in the cart**
6. **Site admin can view orders placed through Django Admin)**
7. **Payment API**
8. **Mobile-friendly**

## Technology Used:
1. Django
2. SQLite (in the form of Django Models)
3. HTTP (GET and POST requests)
4. **API (to implement payment)**

## Languages:
1. Python (backend: Django)
2. HTML (website templates)
3. CSS (HTML Styling)
4. Django templating language (parsing variables from Python views to HTML)
5. Django Models (database)
6. Bootstrap (styling HTML)
7. Javascript (not really, but implementing Google Maps snippet and topping choices dropdown)
